# What is a Container ?

* Standardized, portable packaging for your applications.
* A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing   environment to another.
* Bundlesan application's code together with the related configuration files and libraries, and with the dependencies required for the app to run.
* The problem of an application failing to run correctly arise due to differences in configuration underling library requirements and other dependencies.     Containers address this problem by providing a lightweight, immutable infrastructure for application packaging and deplyment.

  example:
  -------
  
  ### Before Containers:
  App1, Configurations, Dependancies
  
  ### After Containers:
  Configurations, Scripts, App1, Dependancies
