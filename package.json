  "description": "* Standardized, portable packaging for your applications. * A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing   environment to another. * Bundlesan application's code together with the related configuration files and libraries, and with the dependencies required for the app to run. * The problem of an application failing to run correctly arise due to differences in configuration underling library requirements and other dependencies.     Containers address this problem by providing a lightweight, immutable infrastructure for application packaging and deplyment.",
